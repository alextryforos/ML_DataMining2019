# ML_DataMining2019

Final Project for Dr. Bin Li's Data Mining course in Fall 2019. I used an ensemble of Neural Networks to predict concrete strength. Computational power limited the depth of layers, number of nodes, and number of networks. Additionallym, I used a surrogate model to better understand how the neural network was making predictions.
